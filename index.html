                        <strong>Can machine learning be used to design a city?</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        This question drives my research. My research aims at finding a way to use machine learning in urban
                        planning. When
                        buildings are being designed, time consuming simulations need to be done to check various conditions of
                        the building for example for lighting and air flow. There may be as many as 2^70 possible different
                        designs of a
                        building. With all these possibilities, the speed at which simulations are run becomes paramount to
                        whether the problem can be solved at all. Even 5 seconds would be too slow for such a scenario.
                        <br><br>
                        Architects and Engineers currently make only a few designs to be simulated.
                        Such an approach would cause many excellent designs to be ignored. The use of machine learning could
                        potentially solve the problem. Using data set form past simulations, an AI can be created which is able
                        evaluate the design of a building in a much faster way. Simulation that would have taken days can be
                        done by the AI in a few seconds while retaining a high level of accuracy. This would allow the architect
                        to try millions of designs and select the best one a million possible plans instead of just ten, which
                        would help improve the quality of the building.

                        <strong>Meta Learning</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Traditionally, neural networks only work for one dataset. For a new set of data, a new neural network
                        needs to be built from scratch, causing a waste of time and resource. The research aims at producing a
                        general-purpose neural network to handle everything, from airflow in a city to lighting condition of
                        building in another city. A possible way of building such a general-purpose algorithm is meta learning.
                        Meta learning is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied on
                        metadata about machine learning experiments. The main goal is to use such metadata to understand how
                        automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of
                        existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative
                        term learning to learn.
                        <br><br>
                        Flexibility is important because every learning algorithm is based on a set of data assumptions and
                        their inductive bias. This means that only if the bias matches the learning problem will it learn well.
                        In one domain, a learning algorithm can work very well, but not on the next. This poses strong
                        restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between
                        the learning problem (often some type of database) and the effectiveness of different learning
                        algorithms is not yet understood. <a href="javascript:scrollToElem('references')">(1)</a>
                        <br><br>
                        Using different types of metadata, such as learning problem properties, algorithm properties (such as
                        performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, different learning algorithms can
                        be learned, selected, altered or combined to solve a particular learning problem effectively. A good
                        meta-learning analogy considers that genetic evolution learns the learning process encoded in genes and
                        carried out in the brain of each individual. <a href="javascript:scrollToElem('references')">(1)</a>

                        The designs of buildings are represented as meshes/point clouds, which can themselves be thought of as
                        discrete representations of manifolds. Such structures are very different from images (regular
                        2-dimensional grids) or words, in the sense that they do not lie on regular 3-dimensional grids. "The
                        non-Euclidean nature of such data implies that there are no such familiar properties such as global
                        parameterization, common systems of coordinates, vector space structures, or shift-invariance." <a
                            href="javascript:scrollToElem('references')"> (2)</a> Most research into deep learning so far has
                        been focused on 1D, 2D or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images or videos.
                        "Consequently, basic operations like convolution that are taken for granted in the Euclidean case are
                        not well defined on non-Euclidean domains and an alternative approach must be used instead of
                        traditional deep learning techniques." <a href="javascript:scrollToElem('references')"> (2)</a>

                        Recently there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning. Geometric Deep Learning is an
                        emerging sub-field which tries to bring the representational power of neural nets to these unstructured
                        domains, such as data living in manifolds or graphs.
                        Deep learning over non-Euclidean structured data has a range of applications in the domain of network
                        analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics.<a
                            href="javascript:scrollToElem('references')"> (3)</a>
                        Recently, an increasingly large quantity of non-Euclidean structured data such as manifolds or graphs
                        must be processed however traditional deep learning has problems with the non-Euclidean nature of the
                        data. Examples include social networks, transport networks or sensor networks. A solution for urban
                        planning may be geometric deep learning. I hope to build surrogate models of simulations happening on
                        CAD platforms by using the enhanced representational power of Geometric deep learning.

                        environments (datasets, sequences of images) are, which can then be useful for people to (more honestly)
                        benchmark algorithms in robotic navigation tasks.
