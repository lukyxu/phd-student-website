PhD candidate in Computer Science of Imperial College London. My research focuses on Machine Learning for design optimization in architecture and engineering.

I am broadly interested in Statistics, Machine Learning, Stochastic Processes, Formula 1 and Robotics.



Recording (first 10 min)

people make decision
computatation not fast enough
repalce the simulation with somthing faster
---machine Learning
have good mdel and alogorithm
if stat model is good enough , with some data set
replace actual simulation

decision based on simulation
eg air flow
emulate simulation

engineering experience, if we know answer, why replace:

2^70 possibity 5min too long
 1 day -> 1second using neural net
 milliosn more solution
 
 problem:
 pick 10 possibity give to engineer(doing simulation give  back result)
 consider 1million possibity in stead of 10
 
 simulation of lighting, 
 case study vertical skylight component
 
 light goes into window: too low ->dark
 
 simulation 1 min each
 1 year to get good data set
 
next step air flow

general neuralnet for (air-flow, lighting..)

aim: general purpose
meta Learning

typical
dataset A -> fit a network -> make perdiction
B -> start from scratch again

meta Learning
teach it how to Learning
general general representation for Learning task

air for city A,B
light , air

lighting does take long to get data
after finish light, start working on cfd
