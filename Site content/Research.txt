Can machine learning be used to design a city? The answer is yes.  

My research aims at finding a way to use machine learning in urban planning.  When buildings are being designed, engineers use all sorts of time-consuming simulations to check various conditions of the building, for example lighting, air flow. There may be as many as 2^70 possible designs of a building. With all these possibilities, the speed at which simulations are run becomes paramount to whether the problem can be solved at all. Even 5 minutes would be too slow for such a scenario. 

Currently due to time constraints, architects and engineers typically make only a few designs to be simulated. Such an approach leads to potentially thousands of better implementations left undiscovered. 

 The use of machine learning could potentially solve the problem. Using data set form past simulations, an AI can be created which is able evaluate the design of a building in a much faster way. Simulation that would have taken days can be done by the AI in a few seconds while retaining a high level of accuracy. 

 This would allow the architect to try millions of designs and select the best one a million possible plans instead of just ten, which would help improve the overall quality of the building.
