Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that builds a model from example data to
make data driven predictions without having to follow strict static program instructions.
Machine learning can learn from data by using supervised or unsupervised machine learning.
Supervised algorithms require humans to provide the input and the desired output and the
algorithm analyses the features and determines a relationship between an input and output
creating a model which can be used on new data to make predictions. The supervised learning
algorithms includes two categories of algorithms, regression algorithms such as using linear
regression and classification algorithms which include Na√Øve Bayes classifier and logistic
regression.
Unsupervised machine learning involves algorithms which analyse the input data and tries to
identify groups of data with similar traits through inferences from the dataset. Whilst supervised
machine learning is used to predict values, unsupervised machine learning is used in clusters
analysis where the algorithm will try find hidden patterns, groupings or associations in a piece of
data. Algorithms for unsupervised learning include the k-means clustering and the hierarchical
clustering.


Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques that attempt to generalize deep neural models
(structured) to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and The purpose of this paper is to review various examples of
geometric deep learning problems and present solutions, key problems, applications and future research directions in
this emerging field.
